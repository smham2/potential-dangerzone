# What's my IP address?
# Stanley Hammond - 2014
#
# This is a basic script that will display the IP address(es) of the host you are logged into.
# I created this because on some Linux and Mac systems, all I wanted was the IP address and 
# did not want the extra information provided by ifconfig
#
# 10/2015: Added support to return the IP address depending on the architecture of the system
#
# This script is provided AS-IS.  I am not responsible for any damage this script my
# cause to your system.  Use it at your own risk.
