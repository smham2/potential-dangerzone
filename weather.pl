# Command-line Weather Report
# Stan Hammond - 2012 (Updated 2015)
#
# This Perl script queries Weather Underground for the current weather report for 
# a specified area and then parses the report extracting the pertinent information.
# That information is then displayed on the command-line.
# The 2015 update added the ability to modify the city and state in separate variables.
# Originally this needed to be modified in the URL variable.
# Also the update addressed an issue were, depending on the city/state you receive the report
# WU would use different naming for afternoon such as this afternoon or rest of day, etc.
#
# This script is a hack.  So improvements would be:
# 1. Using another weather service than Weather Underground (need uniformity to report)
# 2. Find a better way to get URL data than an external call to curl
# 

# Added the following change that makes changing the city and state easier
$city = "Bourne";
$state = "MA"; # Should be two letter abbreviation

$URL="http://rss.wunderground.com/auto/rss_full/$state/$city.xml?units=english";
@report = `curl -s "$URL"`;

$nday = ++$wday;
$tomorrow = $day[$nday];
